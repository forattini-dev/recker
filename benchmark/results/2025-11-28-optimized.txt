Benchmark Results - November 28, 2025 (After Optimization)
==========================================================

Environment:

- Runtime: Node.js 23.8.0 (x64-linux)
- Tool: mitata

HTTP Clients (GET JSON)
-----------------------

| Client          | Average   | P75       | P99       | Min       | Max       |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| undici (raw)    | 325.15 µs | 362.59 µs | 1.03 ms   | 191.93 µs | 3.84 ms   |
| recker (full)   | 419.97 µs | 482.65 µs | 914.03 µs | 265.94 µs | 2.54 ms   |
| recker (fast)   | 443.22 µs | 475.99 µs | 1.30 ms   | 296.93 µs | 2.15 ms   |
| axios           | 457.53 µs | 496.22 µs | 1.31 ms   | 303.95 µs | 2.61 ms   |
| fetch (native)  | 538.00 µs | 558.30 µs | 1.88 ms   | 349.80 µs | 3.63 ms   |
| got             | 572.27 µs | 616.15 µs | 2.07 ms   | 357.75 µs | 3.40 ms   |
| ky              | 578.01 µs | 587.15 µs | 1.82 ms   | 402.42 µs | 3.23 ms   |

Rankings (by average time):
---------------------------

1. undici (raw)    - 325 µs (baseline)
2. recker (full)   - 420 µs (+29%)  ← WITH FULL OBSERVABILITY!
3. recker (fast)   - 443 µs (+36%)  ← observability: false
4. axios           - 458 µs (+41%)
5. fetch (native)  - 538 µs (+66%)
6. got             - 572 µs (+76%)
7. ky              - 578 µs (+78%)

Key Achievements:
-----------------

✅ RECKER IS NOW FASTER THAN AXIOS, GOT, AND KY!

- Recker (full) beats axios by 8%
- Recker (full) beats got by 27%
- Recker (full) beats ky by 27%
- Recker (full) is only 29% slower than raw undici (compared to 104% before)

The `observability: false` mode doesn't provide significant gains in this test
because the main optimization comes from the improved middleware chain and
avoiding unnecessary object allocations.

Comparison with Previous Run:
-----------------------------

| Client          | Before (throttled) | After (normal) | Improvement |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| undici (raw)    | 2.92 ms           | 325 µs         | ~9x faster  |
| recker (full)   | 5.95 ms           | 420 µs         | ~14x faster |
| axios           | 3.06 ms           | 458 µs         | ~7x faster  |
| got             | 5.67 ms           | 572 µs         | ~10x faster |
| ky              | 8.93 ms           | 578 µs         | ~15x faster |

Note: Previous run had CPU throttled at ~0.50 GHz, this run at ~3.26 GHz.
The relative performance differences are what matter.

Conclusion:
-----------

Recker is now competitive with the fastest HTTP clients available,
while still providing:
- Full middleware architecture
- Observability (timings, connection info)
- Plugin ecosystem
- Type safety
- Streaming support
- SSE support
